	\section{Introduction}

	Hi,

	In the next twenty minutes I’ll present you some of my findings regarding the means by which William Morgan, who translated the Bible into Welsh, bridged the linguistic gap between two different languages, grammatically and lexically~— Biblical Hebrew and Welsh~— producing a natural Welsh text based on his reading of the original text.

	The domain of our examination is the senses\tounfold{@@@}

	This paper is an extension of the one I delivered at the previous Congress, four years ago, which was focused on \textsc{hearing}. In the meantime between congresses I broadened the scope of research, including other senses.
