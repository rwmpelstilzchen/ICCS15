	\section{Conclusion}

	In twenty minutes one can only scratch the surface of the linguistic complexity of Morgan’s work. I didn’t present all details, nor my research is comprehensive and final; nevertheless, I hope I did manage to do \hl{two things}:
	\begin{compactitem}
		\item to present a \hl{formal method} for approaching the subtleties of the translation, by describing the linguistic system that emerges from the text
		\item to exemplify how Morgan produced a \hl{new, natural text} using the Welsh linguistic toolbox, re-creating it according to his interpretation of the original text.
	\end{compactitem}

	Thank you very much!
