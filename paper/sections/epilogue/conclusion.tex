	\section{Conclusion}

	In twenty minutes one can only scratch the surface of the linguistic complexity of Morganâ€™s work. Nevertheless, I hope I did manage to do \hl{two things}:
	\begin{compactitem}
		\item to present a \hl{formal method} for approaching the subtleties of the translation, by describing the linguistic system that emerges from the text
		\item to exemplify how Morgan created a \hl{new text} using the Welsh linguistic toolbox, according to his interpretation of the original text.
	\end{compactitem}

	Thank you very much!
