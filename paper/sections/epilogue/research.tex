\section{Further research}

\begin{paper}
	{\click} In the handout you can see, in a random order, several points I think worthy of \hl{further research}.
	
	In the spirit of \hl{open research}, at the last page of your handout you can see a URL for downloading the handout, presentation and transcription, as well as a subset view of the database. So I’d be really happy to \hl{discuss} this topic with you and hear your comments and ideas, in the question session in a minute, or afterwards.
\end{paper}

\begin{enumerate}[A.]
	\item Comparing, typologically, the situation here with that of other translations of the Bible: other Welsh translations (the 1620 edition and the new translation of 1988/2004), other Celtic translations and translations into other, unrelated, languages. It seems to me especially enriching not only to draw general conclusions about the systemic differences and similarities, but also to examine closely particular verses and see the ways different translators in different languages, periods and cultures choose to interpret the text.


	\item Expanding the procedural working method used here to other kinds of linguistic entities: not only verbs, or even lexemic elements in general, but grammemic elements as well. Of special interest is, to me, the second person pronouns in languages which have, like Welsh, a \mbox{\textit{tu}:\textit{vu}} (\mbox{\C{ti}:\C{chi}(:\C{chdi})}) distinction. By examining the translator’s choices in translating from a language which has no such distinction (Biblical Hebrew, Modern English, etc.) into a language which does have it, we can map the social hierarchies between the characters in the narrative through the translator’s eyes: who is talking to whom with \textit{tu}/\C{ti} in what situations, and who with \textit{vu}/\C{chi}.\footnote{Such a distinction, I believe, will not be seen in machine translation in any foreseeable future, as it involves a deep understanding of {human} social structures.}

		A single photograph from this copy is reproduced there, as Figure~19, which is illegible in the web edition.

		Being able to read these notes can be a peerless aid to a fuller understanding of the 1588 translation, by giving us a glance at a record of the translation process itself. As far as I know, no facsimile edition of the copy has been made. Is there any detailed record as for the content of the notes? Is there any chance to gain access to the actual book and copy them?

	\item Comparing the linguistic system emerging from Morgan’s Bible with other kinds of Welsh. Is the same still holds true in (native) Modern Welsh (literary or colloquial)? What about the contemporary Welsh (c.~1588)? What about older stages of Welsh?

	\item Morgan translated the Hebrew Bible from the Hebrew text. That’s certain. But it is also evident that he did use existing translations in addition: the classical translations (the Greek Septuagint and the Latin Vulgate) and maybe some English translations. To what extant did they affect the translation in question? When did Morgan made use of them, and for what purposes?
