# llygaid [ſydd] ganddynt, ac ni welant: mediating senses through translation choices

In 1588 William Morgan published his monumental Welsh translation of the Bible. This work is notable, among other aspects, in that it has the Old Testament translated directly from the original Hebrew. This fact invites comparative study of the Welsh and Hebrew texts, which may shed light on the Welsh text and language, the translation process, and (the translator’s reading of) the original text.

In this paper I will attempt a close examination of the lexical means by which Morgan translated Hebrew phrases concerning the senses (chiefly verbs of perception). The Hebrew and the Welsh lexicon and grammar are structured differently; that obliges the translator to make constant meaning-bearing choices, interpreting the text according to their reading thereof. Structural description of Morgan’s lexical choices will be at the heart of the paper.

I hope the proposed description, which is based on formal linguistic grounds and aims at understanding (Bible) translations through the lens of structural linguistic analysis, will contribute to our understanding of the 1588 Bible and its language.

(This paper broadens the scope of a paper delivered at ICCS14, in which the semantic field of ‘hearing’ was in focus. Attendance at the previous paper is not required nor assumed.)

*****

No special AV needs. I will bring with me:
* A flash drive containing a PDF file for projection (visual; no audio).
* Printed handouts.

How many handouts should I print? Will there be an estimation as to how many people may attend the paper (based on this congress registration and the attendance of linguistic papers about Welsh in previous congresses)?



# Ni a wnawn, ac a wꝛandawn: William Morgan's Choices in His 1588 Welsh Translation of the Pentateuch — the Case of the Hebrew Verb šmʿ (‘hear’)

Iׁn 1588 William Morgan published his monumental Welsh translation of the Bible. This impressive work is quite atypical of the contemporary Bible translations, as the Old Testament was translated directly from the original Hebrew. This fact invites contrastive study of the Welsh and Hebrew texts, which may shed light on the Welsh text and language, the translation process, and (the translator's reading of) the original text.

In this paper I will attempt a close examination of the semantic field of ‘hearing’ in the Welsh translation of the Pentateuch in comparison with the Hebrew text. A special attention will be given to the means by which Morgan translated the Hebrew verb ‘šmʿ’ (‘hear’), using the Welsh lexemes ‘clywed’ and ‘gwrando’. Apart from some neutralising environments, there seems to be a meaning-bearing lexical opposition between ‘clywed’ and ‘gwrando’: a meaningful choice the translator had to make every time he encountered this Hebrew verb. I hope the proposed description, which is based on formal-structural grounds and aims at understanding (Bible) translations through the lens of structural linguistic analysis, will contribute to our understanding of the 1588 Bible and its language.
